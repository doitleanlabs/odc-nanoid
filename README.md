# odc-nanoid


## Getting started

This assets is a source code for OutSystems External Logic NanoID
Nano ID is a library for generating random IDs. Likewise UUID, there is a probability of duplicate IDs. However, this probability is extremely small.

Safe. It uses cryptographically strong random generator.
Compact. It uses more symbols than UUID (A-Za-z0-9_-) and has the same number of unique options in just 22 symbols instead of 36.
Fast. Nanoid is as fast as UUID but can be used in URLs.
